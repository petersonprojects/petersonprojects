                    <p class="lead mb-5">I'm a fullstack web developer with a background in food service and baking. 
                        I first joined the workforce when I was 15 years old, working at a local BBQ restaurant. 
                        I realized early-on I loved working with food and I loved the people who did too. 
                        I stayed on this path for about six years where I worked at various companies, large and small, working throughout college and trying to balance money and grades. 
                        I then transitioned into a slighly different role of bread baking. Even though the roles were very different objectively, all the skills I had learned in food service transferred swimmingly into baking. 
                        Baking became a huge passion for me. <br><br>At home I curated several of my own recipes from my own unique perspective, mastered the french baguette, and developed expert-level understanding of yeasts and starter cultures. 
                        Then I came to a very important road block. I realized that the positions I had at each bakery I worked at were essentially dead ends. 
                        I couldn't focus in on the learning and teaching of baking, and had to focus more on daily routine. The passion began to fade. If I wasn't going to be learning new skills and pushing my boundaries, I wasn't going to be happy.
                        This meant in order to pursue bread, I needed to open up my own bake shop, but unfortunately the resources weren't there.
                        <br><br> So in order to decide what to do with my future, I took an in-depth look at my past. Through my education I had learned to code in Java and Python at an intermediate level. I remade games like Frogger from scratch
                        and created an arcade-style shooter game of my very own when I was only 16. At age 24, on one fateful night, I decided to pick up my old code and have another go at it. I haven't put it down since.
                        I imagined what kind of amazing things I could do with all the new developer technologies out there that weren't available to me ten years ago.
                        It was time to finally pursue software development. When I immsersed myself into the coding world again, I discovered it was much larger than I had remembered, and it felt more appropriate to call it a coding universe or realm.
                        The capabilities of code are endless, and it's the perfect career to pursue for those like me who just can't stop learning and growing without bounds. <br><br>
                        <b>TL;DR - </b> Baker by hobby, developer by trade.</p>
